# Contribution
First of all, thanks for thinking in contributing to this project! Salamandra is an open source software, so any contributions are welcome.

Right now, what we really need is for Salamandra to be tested. It's meant to be stable, but bugs and unexpected behaviors can happen, even more in these initial releases.
